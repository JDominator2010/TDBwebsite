Jackson and Bobby aka. The Dragon Brothers, have done robotics have done robotics for multiple years. Starting in 6th grade year when we decided to impulsively join the robotics team and instantly loved it. We try to splt up our roles evenly, mainly, we both try to do the building, while Bobby does the driving and Jackson (aka the one writing this) does all of the coding. Though a third person to act as a notebooker would be nice, our two person dynamic has worked well for us for many years.
