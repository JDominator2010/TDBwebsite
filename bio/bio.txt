Spin Up overall wasnt one of our most favorite games, While we did do well and did enjoy the game, it just wasnt able to beat spinup. Yet again we did not make it to worlds, but we did go back to the U.S Open, this time we brought home the Mega alliance champion trophy, which we were very proud of. We did make a good looking bot this year and it definetly functioned well. Overall, we did pretty good this year and were most definetly proud of ourselves.
