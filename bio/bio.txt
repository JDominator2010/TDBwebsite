Spin up was and still is our favorite game vex has done by and far. Even though at the game reveal at worlds we were scared and though to ourselves "How is this even gonna be possible". But we came up with some great designs and really has been our best year yet. Though we did not make it to worlds, it was the first year that we went to the U.S Open, which was a great expierence, especially the mega alliance challenge. Overall, we were so insanely proud of ourselves this year.
